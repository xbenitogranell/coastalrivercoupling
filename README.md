# coastalrivercoupling

This is an initial repository to model long-term river-coastal ecological couplings between water quality, climate, and artisanal fisheries in the Ebro Delta (NE Mediterranean)

### Repository structure
1. `scripts`: code for running statistical analyses in order
2. `data`: raw datasets (fish catches, river physico-chemical variables, climate descriptors) to be read in <i>R scripts</i>
3. `outputs`: plots resulting from analyses in <i>R scripts</i>
